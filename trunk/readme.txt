== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can't choose any Post Type to filtering =

Do you have any? Plugin currently allows only to choose Post Type which is public and have archive (relays on archive template when displaying results). It may going to change in future releases.

= What is this weird "Filtering parameters" thing? How to deal with it? =

It's YAML representation of filtering parameters, [schema for it is in the code](https://github.com/marsjaninzmarsa/WordPress-J-QueryFilter/blob/master/schema.yaml), more detailed how-to is on the way. It is going to change in future releases to more user-friendly, drag'n'drop visual interface.

= You have AJAX working on your demo, I don't, how to live, what to do?  =

If you are developer, you can adapt your Theme to support it, demo code on the way. If you aren't and you don't understand what happen if you press Ctrl+U, you must hire one for it. It is going to change in future releases.
